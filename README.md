# RL_ChessBot

In this project, we created a reinforment learning algorithm to learn how to play various games strategically. For the purposes of this project, we'll be applying this algorithm to the game of chess. The particular algorithm we'll be using for our foundation is Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and will learn chess through self-play.
